Hi! 👋 I am a proven leader in Healthcare AI, I build and scale enterprise-grade intelligence platforms for the most demanding healthcare and life sciences organizations. My focus is on leading the entire vertical, from pioneering research to full-scale production. With a foundation of over 14 years in public research at France's CNRS, I have a deep understanding of the science. I translated this into commercial success by leading the team behind John Snow Labs' Spark NLP—the most widely used NLP library in the enterprise, which now powers the majority of medical AI models on major cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker and Bedrock.

My work is guided by one core principle: the future of medical AI must be open, auditable, and sovereign. This isn't just a philosophy; it's the go-to-market strategy that wins in regulated environments. This conviction led me to found OpenMed, an initiative to create and share transparent, state-of-the-art medical language models. I believe that for AI to be truly trusted in clinical settings, it cannot be a black box and must be deployable within a hospital's own secure walls.

My leadership is built on a full-stack technical foundation. I have hands-on expertise in the entire AI lifecycle, from training domain-specific LLMs (100M to 200B+ parameters) to architecting the national-scale, on-premise infrastructure they require. This includes managing billion-row databases on everything from bare-metal servers to hardened Kubernetes clusters, work I continue as an Infrastructure Project Manager at the Institute of Complex Systems of Paris (ISCPIF).

My mission is to leverage Europe's leading AI to build the default engine for every hospital, pharma giant, and public health agency that requires a secure and powerful medical intelligence platform. I specialize in turning cutting-edge scientific research into robust, compliant, and commercially successful enterprise solutions.
